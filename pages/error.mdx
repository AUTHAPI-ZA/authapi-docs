## Error Codes

Here is a table of common error codes that you may encounter while using AUTHAPI. Each error code is accompanied by a brief description of the issue and possible solutions.

| Error Code | Description | Solution |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| `401 Unauthorized` | The request lacks valid authentication credentials. | Ensure that the provided authentication credentials (API key, tokens) are valid and have the necessary permissions. |
| `403 Forbidden` | The authenticated user does not have the necessary permissions. | Check the user's role and permissions. Make sure they have the required access to perform the requested operation. |
| `404 Not Found` | The requested resource could not be found. | Verify that the specified resource (user, endpoint) exists and is correctly spelled in the request. |
| `422 Unprocessable Entity` | The request is well-formed but contains invalid parameters. | Review the request payload and ensure that all required parameters are provided and correctly formatted. |
| `409 Conflict` | The requested operation conflicts with the current state of the server. | Resolve any conflicting conditions (e.g., duplicate user account) before reattempting the operation. |
| `428 Precondition Required` | The request requires MFA, but it was not provided. | Include the required MFA information in the request headers or payload. |
| `429 Too Many Requests` | The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time. | Slow down the request rate to avoid being rate-limited. Consider implementing exponential backoff. |
| `500 Internal Server Error` | An unexpected error occurred on the server. | Retry the request, and if the issue persists, contact technical support with details about the request. |
| `502 Bad Gateway` | The AUTHAPI server received an invalid response from the OAuth provider. | Check the OAuth provider's status and verify the integration details. |
