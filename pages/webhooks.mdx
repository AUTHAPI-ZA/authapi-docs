# Webhooks

## Overview

Webhooks are a way to send data from one application to another when something of interest happens. They are sometimes called "Reverse APIs," as they give you what amounts to an API spec, and you must design an API for the webhook to use.

### Enable your AUTHAPI app to receive webhooks

<Steps>

### Step 1: Add a webhook receiver to your app

Add a webhook receiver to your app. This is the URL that AUTHAPI will send data to when a webhook is triggered and the Method (GET or POST) that AUTHAPI will use to send the data.

You can use [Mock HTTP Server](https://beeceptor.com/) to test your webhook receiver and see what data is sent to it.

### Step 2: Add a webhook handier to your app

Add a webhook handier to your app. This is the code that will receive the data sent by AUTHAPI and process it. Here is an example of a webhook handier in Express.js:

Method: `POST`

```js

const express = require('express')
const app = express()

app.post('/webhook', (req, res) => {
    console.log(req.body)

    // You can update your database here

    res.send('OK')
})

app.listen(3000)

```

Method: `GET`

```js

const express = require('express')
const app = express()

app.get('/webhook', (req, res) => {
    console.log(req.query)

    // You can update your database here

  res.send('OK')
})

app.listen(3000)
```

### Step 3: Add a webhook to your app

Add a webhook to your app. This is the webhook that will be triggered when a user is created, updated, deleted, verified, blocked, unblocked, logged in or logged out.

### Step 4: Test your webhook

Test your webhook by creating, updating, deleting, verifying, blocking, unblocking, logging in or logging out a user. You should see the data sent by AUTHAPI in your webhook receiver and the data processed by your webhook handier in your webhook handier. If you don't see the data sent by AUTHAPI in your webhook receiver or the data processed by your webhook handier in your webhook handier, check your webhook receiver and webhook handier for errors.
Otherwise, Yey! You have successfully set up your webhook!

</Steps>

## Webhook data

The data sent to your webhook receiver will be in JSON format and will look like this:

```json
{
    "type": "LOGIN",
    "data": {
        "city": "New York",
        "country": "US",
        "device": "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/94.0.4606.81 Safari/537.36",
        "email": "jondoe@email.com",
        "email_verified": true,
        "ip": "::0",
        "location": "40.71455,-74.007118",
        "time": "2021-10-15T14:48:00.000Z",
        "uid": "1234567890",
        "verified_at": "2021-10-15T14:48:00.000Z"
    }
}
```
